# 🌍 GeoGini — Explore the Earth Intelligently

**GeoGini** is an interactive geospatial intelligence platform powered by Google Earth Engine, satellite data, and AI.  
Draw regions on the map, extract real metrics like **NDVI**, **Land Surface Temperature**, **Rainfall**, and get **AI-generated insights** based on both data and uploaded images.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Select a region** on the map — the app captures it via GEE's `drawingTools`.
2. **Metrics are computed** using `reduceRegion` and sent via `postMessage`.
3. **React frontend receives metrics**, displays them, and auto-fills the AI form.
4. **You upload an image** or just type a prompt — and get a **Mistral-generated response**.
5. **Time-series modal** shows a summary of average values across a year.

## 🧪 Try It Yourself

✅ Open [https://geogini.netlify.app](https://geogini.netlify.app)  
✅ Draw a rectangle on the map  
✅ Wait for metrics to load  
✅ Ask questions like:

> _"Explain the land use and vegetation in this region."_  
> _"How does the rainfall affect habitability here?"_

Or upload an image and ask:

> _"What environmental challenges can you guess from this?"_
